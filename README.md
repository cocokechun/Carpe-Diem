# Welcome to Coco's Page

Hey this Coco, always curious to learn new techonologies and come up with new ideas.
I have a few repos that you can check out projects I do for fun.

## ML

Machine learning projects I have tried. I started some with some tutorials and try to do fun things with them. Some are more creative types.

### CNN Project

In this project, I tried playing around some common existing CNN models, with Keras library (highly recommend), like Inception V3, ResNet 50. And do transfer learning on these models with a flower dataset I found in Kaggle.

## [Programming](https://github.com/cocokechun/Programming)

Competitive programming questions I have written in the past, mainly in college.

## [Coursera ML](https://github.com/cocokechun/CourseraML)

I took Machine Learning course on Coursera and have all the homework in that folder.
