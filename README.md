## Welcome to Coco's Page

Hey this Coco, always curious to learn new techonologies and come up with new ideas.
I have a few repos that you can check out projects I do for fun.

### ML

Machine learning projects I have tried. I started some with some tutorials and try to do fun things with them. Some are more creative types.

CNN Project: In this project, I tried playing around some common existing CNN models, with Keras library (highly recommend), like Inception V3, ResNet 50. And do transfer learning on these models with a flower dataset I found in Kaggle.
I mainly followed this [tutorail](https://deeplearningsandbox.com/how-to-use-transfer-learning-and-fine-tuning-in-keras-and-tensorflow-to-build-an-image-recognition-94b0b02444f2). In fact, a lot of code samples on [Keras official website](https://keras.io/applications/#inceptionv3) as well. More details and performance review in the repo.

### [Programming](https://github.com/cocokechun/Programming)

Competitive programming questions I have written in the past, mainly in college.

### Coursera ML

I took Machine Learning course on Coursera and have all the homework in that folder.
